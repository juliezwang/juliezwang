		<div id="textbox" class="description">Hello! My name is Julie Wang and I am a first-year Sustainable Environmental Design major at the University of California, Berkeley. I was born and raised in the city of Los Angeles and I am aspiring to become a front-end web developer. Throughout my high school career, I was very involved in music and played in my school's drumline. I LOVE traveling and going on hikes--especially the ones with an amazing view at the top of the summit and the ones that lead up to a waterfall. My favorite dish has to be the homemade Bun Rieu that my aunt makes when she visits California every year. I love watching live musicals and dressing up for a fancy night out in the theatre. Last fall, I joined Cal Wushu and although I am currently a beginner, I hope to compete sometime during my college career. My favorite memory from start of 2017 was going up to Lake Tahoe with my wushu family. No joke, THE SNOW WAS SOO FLUFFY AND PURE WHITE! I must've fallen a few hundred times while snowboarding and faceplanted a few dozen times, but the fun made up for it. I recently fell in love with San Francisco and want to someday work in The City. This is all for now :) </div>
