				This past summer, my family decided to fly up to Seattle, Washington and drive up to Vancouver, Canada right when we landed. After spending about a week in Vancouver, we drove back down to Washington and finally explored Seattle! I have to say... we got very lucky during this trip. Right when we left Vancouver, it started raining. But, as we entered Washington, the sky started to clear up and for the few days we ended up spending in Seattle, it didn't rain! Not even a slight drizzle! I like to say that Vancouver was crying because we were leaving and that Seattle was happy and cheerful as we arrived :).

				My family loves going on hikes and of course, we had to check out some of the best hikes of Seattle/Washington. We made our way to Snoqualmie Falls--only to find out that it wasn't a hike at all! The actual hike was closed off and we reached the waterfall within a matter of 5 minutes! It was more like a walk to the falls. While the waterfall was beautiful, we still wanted to get our excercise in. So, the Adventurous Wang Family ultimately made their way to Rattesnake Mountain. Let me just say, THIS HIKE WAS INTENSE! Partly because we hiked up a large rocky road that were meant for cars to drive on! No wonder our view of nature was nowhere to be seen. I was looking at asphalt the entire hike up the mountain! We finally found the actual hiking trail on our way down and YES! That was the hike we were looking forward to the entire time we were there!

				Like a typical tourist, we also visted the must-see spots in Seattle--the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and the FIRST STARBUCKS! I'm no crazy Starbucks fan, but... we just had to order something there! IT'S THE FIRST EVER STARBUCKS! We'd be crazy not to be like every other tourist and pass this opportunity up heh. Of course, I ended up going up to the Space Needle and enjoyed the view. I learned something new during the elevator ride up, that there's a volcano in Seattle and that the day was clear enough so I can see it:) Yes, Mount Rainer is a pretty famous volcano, but who knew I'd be able to see a volcano in person(even if it was like 70 miles away)? Pike Place Market is a must see center. Within the first ten minutes of getting there, we saw a show. It was no ordinary show... I SAW FISHMONGERS THROW FISH! Let me just say, how often does one get to see raw fish get thrown in the air?? Well..not very often if you're me.

				The next day, we decided to go to Pioneer Square and came across the Waterfall Garden. This little spot is hidden and not very well-known. It's a small area that is characterized by the rushing sounds of water from a man-made waterfall. It's definitely a must-see spot for someone who is too lazy to go on a hike but still wants to relax in an area filled with the aroma of the misty waters, the sounds of water splashing, and the sight of plants, trees, and beautiful flowers. Who would've known that a closed-off space characterized by brick walls would encompass a nature-filled environment? This was a spot of discovery and surprise.

				My trip ends here. I have to say, this was a trip of happiness, surprise, and discovery. Thank you for such a great vacation Seattle! I hope I get to see you soon.
